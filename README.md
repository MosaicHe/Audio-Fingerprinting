COMP 124:  Audio Fingerprinting
==========================

This is an audio recognition program that is similar in style to the Shazam app.
The application works by first analyzing a directory of songs and creating digital fingerprints(e.g. a hash code)for each one. These fingerprints are
stored in a map to allow fast lookups. Once the map is created, your application will allow you to either load a song clip or listen
with your computer's microphone. The recorded sounds will be fingerprinted and compared to existing songs in the map to identify the
song that was played.
